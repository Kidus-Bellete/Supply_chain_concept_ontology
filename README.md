# Supply Chain Ontology README

## Overview

The Supply Chain Ontology represents various concepts and relationships involved in a supply chain. It provides a structured framework to model and understand the interactions between suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customers, products, and other related elements. This ontology is designed to support applications such as supply chain management, data integration, and analytics.
